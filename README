This is a boilerplate for Chrome app, extension, and theme development.

Most of the boilerplate is scribbed together from the docs at
http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions and the icons auto-generated at
http://faviconist.com. It's all MIT-licensed.

INSTALLATION

  The boilerplate works out of the box, so start by installing it in Chrome:

  - Visit chrome://extensions
  - Ensure you're in development mode
  - Choose "Load unpacked extension ..." and point to this directory.
  - You should see a new button in your address bar. Click it for the latest news.

CUSTOMIZATION

  By default, most things are commented out - uncomment them to make them active.

  UI EXPOSURE

    Your extension can be an app, an action (address bar popup), or a theme,
    but it can only be one of these. Or if it does other stuff, maybe it won't
    do any at all. So at most only one of these can be uncommented.

  PERMISSIONS
  
    For convenience, these are mostly selected by default (except "experimental",
    as it requires you run Chrome wiht a special flag). Be sure to comment out
    what you don't need - i.e., most of them - before distributing your extension.

  LOCALES 

    A basic locale setup is included, with English declared as the default
    language. This won't do any harm even if you're not planning to localize your app.

WHO MADE THIS?

  Michael Mahemoff (http://mahemoff.com). I was previously working in Google's
  Chrome team, but am no longer at Google and this is not an official
  Google/Chrome project.
